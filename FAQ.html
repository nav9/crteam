                    <h5>So you guys do social work?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Well, yes; but 'social work' is different from 'community relations' (CR), which is what we're engaged in. Social workers have a totally different brand identity. We are volunteers and we do volunteering.

                    <p>
                        Honestly you don't have to learn how to help people. However, we can guide you by example and we place emphasis on contributing time, skill and care. The people whom you help shouldn't start liking you for the material things you give them.
                        Volunteering for the environment and emergency management involves some learning which people from Company and some of our volunteers can help out with. Just let us know.

                    <p>
                        If it's about anonymity or you're uncomfortable working in a flamboyant group or if you can't find like-minded people, we can guide you toward NGO's and homes for the disadvantaged, where you can contribute your time and skill wholeheartedly. These people are accustomed to receiving volunteers, so won't have unreasonable expectations from you and you can easily find your comfort level and people whom you can work with.

                    <h5>What is it like to volunteer at an NGO?</h5>
                    <p>

                        Plenty of companies and colleges send people to NGO's to do 30 hours of compulsory social service. When the inmates of the NGO find that you're volunteering genuinely and not out of some compulsory rule, they're very welcoming and understanding. They'll give you options of how you can help, and you can choose what you like.
                        You can create a software for them, teach them Excel, C++ or PowerPoint, build them a kitchen-garden, plant saplings, perform a magic show, teach them their subjects in an interesting way, spend time talking to them, have fun painting the walls, bring them for an educational visit to SED or anything that you would enjoy doing for them that can help them.
                        These are only the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot more. Besides, volunteering isn't only done at NGO's.

                    <p>
                        We thought ten times before including this question here, but it's relevant. Your dear ones do come first, but you know what? Bring your wife with you to volunteer. Believe us, you'll have a lot more fun and spend meaningful time together than if you went to a movie. There's a little something that's special about volunteering.
                        Some wise parents introduce their children to volunteering at an early age. We enthusiastically encourage you to do the same. Family is always welcome!

                    <h5>Why don't you spread word more actively?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Putting up posters everywhere and tips sent via all_mumbai mails don't work anymore. We realise that people don't bother, not because they dislike it but because they don't have the time for it. No nonsense, we respect your time. Moreover, we want our message to spread through your words and actions. That's when it gets a life, and that's when it's genuine!

                        p.s: publicising volunteering to the media (T.V, newspaper etc.) is forbidden by Company.

                    <p>

                        Yes, but when we proved that we could stand on our own feet, we became an independent volunteering unit. We're still part of them and constantly in touch with Company volunteers. We take guidance and help from them while sharing our experience as well.

                        It's as fast as its fastest volunteer ' you!
                        Volunteering is not about what CR team wants to do. It's about what you want to do. Bring forward your idea and be ready to execute it. We will help out in every possible way we can with our network. It always helps to have like-minded people to help you out too.

                    <p>
                        The company does not donate through volunteering, but you can donate as an individual. NGO's accept monetary donations and donations in kind (non-monetary things). You can donate rice, pulses, soaps, blankets and anything that helps in running a home for the underprivileged. 
                        (If you're also looking for tax benefits, you might want to check what percentage of the donated amount qualifies for the tax benefit)
