ATTRIBUTIONS FOR SOME AWESOME OPEN SOURCE CODE !!!  
  
============ Interactive web ===============  
The interactive web (experience) was likely created by Jorge Epuñan.  
  
Jorge Epuñan has released a lot of projects under the MIT license, so this code  
is also assumed to be under MIT: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT  
With no contact details provided, no specific permissions were obtained for the   
reuse of the code. But due attribution is hereby given for an awesome piece of  
work. If any objections, kindly write to navinipe at gmail dot com.  
  
The code of the interactive web is being used for a non-profit purpose and only  
for the sake of aesthetics.  
  
============ Background patterns ===============  
  
 Background patterns (if used) are downloaded from www.subtlepatterns.com

Terms  
  
All resources available on CodyHouse can be used freely in both personal and commercial projects.  

You are not allowed to take our work “as-is” and redistribute or sell it somewhere else. Our resources have to be part of a more complex work (i.e. you cannot sell a “pluginized” version of our resources).  

You don’t have to link back to us but we always appreciate credit!  

Please, respect the licenses of the resources we use in our demos.  

If you write about our resources, we would appreciate a back link. You are free to copy excerpts but do not copy entire articles.  

Don’t re-publish our demos and our ZIP files, and don’t link directly to any ZIP file, link to the article instead.  

Enjoy our resources!
