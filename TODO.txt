Emergency:
-----------------------------------------------------
nothing


Important:
-----------------------------------------------------
* Team to become familiar with Skeleton CSS and existing CSS Boilerplate
* Gallery can be changed to a page full of thumbnail views (actual thumbnails not required. The image width and height can be altered) which when clicked, shows the image in a lightbox
* A main-menu script can generate the main menu instead of hard-coding it into every page.
* S-Helping section to be created with JSP, MySQL (or Neo4J or MongoDB) and JQuery


Somewhat-Important:
-----------------------------------------------------
* Team page to use skeleton for displaying photos
* Polls section to be initiated. Current poll graph goes outside website display space on browser resize
* Feedback/Testimonial section to be initiated
* The envelope on interact page blocks menu links. CRTeam Delhi mailto link is not clickable.
* Add a section in the interact page where we show people what ideas we have received from them and what has been done about it (this is a first step. The next step is to have a facility to allow them to enter their suggestions and submit it)


Minor:
-----------------------------------------------------
* Heading fonts and text fonts in general to be made uniform on all pages
* Trianglify requires a refresh when browser is resized
* favicon of tomcat to be replaced with CRTeam favicon
* At least one Mumbai CRTeam member to be given access to main server 172.20.110.82
* CSS class names like fullWidthDivAutoSpacing to be changed to better names
* Migrate the "img" folder into "gallery"



TODO's before releasing website for public viewing:
-----------------------------------------------------
* Website to be tested with different browsers to see if it shows the message of "javascript not supported" or "browser not supported".
* Website to be tested under different screen resolutions, zooming and resizing.
* Entire website to be checked with a Xenu linkchecker
* CSS could be minified and/or obfuscated before release (optional)
* Check if timelines work (the primitive Git UI changes LF to CRLF which cause the timeline not to function)


Wishlist:
-----------------------------------------------------
* To have a synchronized server in Bangalore and/or Delhi so that content loading won't take time
* To put points of this page onto a professional tracker like Apache Bloodhound, Trac, Bugzilla or Mantis.
* To have a separate blog page for volunteers to share their thoughts
* To have a forum where volunteers can discuss and plan (MyBB or PHPBB)
